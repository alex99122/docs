## Quick example

```javascript example.js
// Initialize the SDK with your API token
const payviox = new Payviox('your_api_token');

// Create a payment session
const sessionId = await payviox.createSession({
  amount: 1000,
  currency: 'USD',
  customer: 'customer_123',
  description: 'Order #12345',
  paymentMethodId: 'pm_card',
  order_id: 'order_12345',
  items: [
    {
      name: 'Product A',
      quantity: 2,
      price: 500
    }
  ]
}, {
  redirect: true
});
```

## Integration modes

### Redirect mode

Redirect your customers to a secure Payviox-hosted payment page. This is the simplest integration method and provides a fully managed payment experience.

<Tip>
Redirect mode is recommended for quick integrations and provides the highest level of PCI compliance.
</Tip>

### Iframe mode

Embed the payment flow directly into your website using an iframe. This provides a more seamless user experience while maintaining security.

<Warning>
When using iframe mode, ensure your domain is whitelisted in your Payviox dashboard settings.
