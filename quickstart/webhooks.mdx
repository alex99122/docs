## Understanding Webhooks

Webhooks are **essential** for confirming payments. They provide real-time notifications when payment events occur.

<Warning>
**Important:** Always use webhooks to confirm payments. Don't rely solely on customer redirects, as customers may close their browser before returning to your site.
</Warning>

## How Webhooks Work

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure your webhook URL">
Set up your webhook endpoint URL in the [Payviox Dashboard](https://dash.payviox.com)
</Step>

<Step title="Payviox sends a POST request">
When payment events occur, Payviox sends a POST request to your configured URL
</Step>

<Step title="Your server receives the notification">
Your server endpoint receives the webhook with complete payment details
</Step>

<Step title="Verify the signature">
Always verify the webhook signature to ensure it's from Payviox and hasn't been tampered with
</Step>

<Step title="Process the payment">
Fulfill the order, send confirmation emails, update your database, etc.
</Step>

<Step title="Return 200 OK">
Respond with HTTP 200 status to acknowledge receipt of the webhook
</Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Payload Example

```json
{
  "amount": 10000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "fees": 350,
  "metadata": {
    "integration_session_id": "sess_abc123xyz"
  },
  "type": "succeeded",
  "provider": "stripe",
  "order_id": "order_123456",
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "Premium Subscription",
      "quantity": 1,
      "price": 10000
    }
  ],
  "payment_method": "card",
  "customer": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
}
```

<Tip>
The `type` field indicates the payment event type: `succeeded`, `pending_review`, `declined`, `refunded`. The `fees` field indicates total fees in the smallest currency unit - customer pays `amount + fees = total`.
</Tip>

<Info>
The `customer` field is optional and only present when customer data was collected during payment. It may include `name`, `email`, `phone`, and `address` depending on the payment provider.
</Info>

## Webhook Event Types

Payviox sends different webhook events based on the payment lifecycle:

| Event | Description | Action Required |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| `succeeded` | Payment completed successfully | ✅ Fulfill order |
| `pending_review` | Payment flagged for fraud review | ⏳ Wait for final decision |
| `declined` | Payment declined by fraud prevention (auto-refunded) | ❌ Do NOT fulfill |
| `refunded` | Refund processed for a transaction | 📦 Handle return/cancellation |

<Warning>
**Important:** If you receive `pending_review`, do NOT ship or fulfill the order until you receive either `succeeded` or `declined`.
</Warning>

## What Happens During Payment?

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="1. Session Creation (Your Application)">
Your application creates a payment session by calling Payviox with:
- **Amount** (in smallest currency unit, e.g., cents)
- **Currency** (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
- **Order details** (customer ID, order ID, items)
- **Payment method** (card, crypto, bank transfer, etc.)

Payviox returns a session ID and secure payment URL.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Payment Processing (Payviox)">
The customer is redirected to Payviox's secure payment page where:
- Payment form is displayed with selected payment method
- Customer enters payment details
- Payment is processed through the appropriate provider (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
- Transaction is encrypted and secured
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. Webhook Notification (Payviox → Your Server)">
Immediately after payment processing:
- Payviox sends a webhook POST request to your configured URL
- Includes payment status, amount, order ID, and all details
- **This is your source of truth** for payment confirmation
- Retries automatically if your server doesn't respond
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. Customer Redirect (Back to Your Site)">
After payment:
- Customer is redirected back to your website
- URL includes session ID as parameter
- You can show a confirmation page
- **Note:** Always rely on webhooks, not just redirects
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
