    Payviox-->>YourApp: Returns session ID
    
    alt SDK Integration (Redirect)
        YourApp->>PaymentPage: Redirect customer
    else SDK Integration (Iframe)
        YourApp->>PaymentPage: Open in iframe
    else API Integration
        YourApp->>PaymentPage: Send customer to URL
    end
    
    Customer->>PaymentPage: Completes payment
    PaymentPage->>Payviox: Process payment
    
    Payviox->>Webhook: Send payment confirmation
    Webhook-->>Payviox: Return 200 OK
    
    PaymentPage->>YourApp: Redirect customer back
    Customer->>YourApp: Sees confirmation page
```

## Step-by-Step Flow

<Steps>
<Step title="Customer initiates payment">
Your customer clicks a "Pay Now" button or starts the checkout process on your website.
</Step>

<Step title="Create a payment session">
Your application calls Payviox (via SDK or API) to create a payment session with order details, amount, currency, and items.
</Step>

<Step title="Redirect to secure payment page">
The customer is redirected to Payviox's secure payment page (or it opens in an iframe) where they can complete their payment.
</Step>

<Step title="Customer completes payment">
The customer enters their payment details and confirms the transaction on the secure Payviox page.
</Step>

<Step title="Webhook notification">
**Immediately after payment**, Payviox sends a webhook to your server with the payment status and details. This is how you know the payment was successful.
</Step>

<Step title="Customer returns to your site">
After payment, the customer is redirected back to your website where you can show them a confirmation page.
</Step>
</Steps>
