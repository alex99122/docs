## Welcome to Payviox Payout API

The Payviox Payout API allows you to allocate funds to users, manage payout balances, and enable users to withdraw their allocated funds through various payout methods including gift cards, crypto, and more.

<Note>
  **Enable Payouts First:** Before using the Payout API, ensure payouts are enabled for your business in the dashboard settings.

## Key Concepts

### Business Payout Balance

Each business has a dedicated `payout_balance` field that is separate from your main business balance. This balance is used exclusively for payout operations:

- Funds are debited from `payout_balance` when you allocate funds to users
- You must have sufficient `payout_balance` before creating payout users
- Balance operations are atomic to prevent race conditions

### Payout Users

Payout users are identified by their email address and are unique per business:

- **Email-based identification**: Each email address represents a unique payout user for your business
- **Balance allocation**: Users have an allocated balance amount (stored in cents)
- **Status**: Users can be `active` or `inactive`
- **Hash**: Each user receives a unique SHA256 HMAC hash for secure verification

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fund Your Payout Balance">

The Payout API uses two types of authentication:

2. **Hash Authentication**: Used by payout users to access their funds and make withdrawals

See the [Authentication guide](/api/payout/authentication) for detailed information.
